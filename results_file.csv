This was a simple task to fit a linear regression in a dataset comprising of no. of hours a student studies and the percentage of marks the student score and predict the percentage of marks the student will score if he studies for 9.25 hours. However, I went one step ahead and improved the prediction model by incorporating a curve that plateaus out as the percentage score reaches 100. As a result, the function was able to completely describe the data set as well as predict the values more accurately. Your feedback is welcomed.

My training at BSNL started with classroom sessions to grasp the concepts of different instruments and technologies used in the telephone exchange. We were given lectures on all the technologies BSNL delved into and at the end of the week, we were instructed to present a presentation on the basis of our learning. After the classes were completed, we spent a week at different departments and assisted the administrators in the day to day operations. During my time with the customer care department, I helped the technicians in solving a data and records management query. In the third week, I was responsible for noting down readings coming from different landline telephone connection faults and then creating a digital record for the same. At the end of the fifth week, we were sent to various locations in the city to assess the signal strength of all the services provided by BSNL and construct a report and present our findings to our advisors.\n\xe2\x80\xa6\nsee moreNew York University\nDegree Name\nMasters\nField Of Study\nComputer Engineering\nDates attended or expected graduation\n2019 \xe2\x80\x93 2021\nJaipur Engineering College & Research Center,jaipur\nDegree Name\nBachelor of Technology\nField Of Study\nElectrical, Electronics and Communications Engineering\nGrade\nHonours\nDates attended or expected graduation\n2014 \xe2\x80\x93 2018\nActivities and Societies: Sports Team coordinator and Basketball Team CaptainLearning Python\nIssuing authority\nLinkedIn\nIssued date and, if applicable, expiration date of the certification or license\nIssued Jul 2020No Expiration DateVolunteer\nCompany Name\nAU BANK JAIPUR MARATHON\nDates volunteered\nFeb 2017\nVolunteer duration\n1 mo\nCause\nSocial Services\nThe AU Bank Jaipur Marathon, abbreviated as AUBJM is an annual international marathon held in Jaipur, India, on the Sunday of February every year.

Earlier I have written it for PCA. But the PCA is a bit old and has some limitations in it. The T-SNE is very new to the actual research paper published in 2008 by Geoffrey Hinton. Also, it works on conditional probability and finds create the cluster of points that are nearer to each other and then embed them into 1D space. In the article, I have also explained the crowding problem we usually face in TSNE, and the solution to it is T-distributed SNE. In the data visualization part, I have taken the MINST dataset and used T-SNE on it. you can see a scatter plot for this in the article.

That's why they are robust to small market changes. FB have people's network Apple have strong brand Google have user's data Amazon have strong distribution network Now, if we see Swiggy/Zomato, they don't have something that much unique which can't be replicated. That's why they are competing & running on billions of dollars to survive because of the competition. Same goes for Uber/Ola. Even if they get market share, anyone can come & threaten them.

Increase followers on Social Media 2. Sell Useless Products to their peers 3. Share Stories on Social Media about you 4. Increase App Downloads 5. Increase ""Positive"" Reviews for your app 6. And at the end don\'t pay them anything This is not a Marketing internship. Period. It\'s easy to fool a newbie just for the sake of a Certificate and LOR, which is worth nothing. But how are companies able to exploit students? Because somewhere deep within, that ""Certificate"" Mindset hasn\'t gone entirely out of the mind of students. But trust me even if you get that Certificate, when you apply in an authentic company, you will not get that job /internship. Why? Because you won\'t be able to answer the most basic questions. So, if you are doing something just for the sake of a certificate, please don\'t do that. Trust me. No client has asked me about my certificates. NONE. And also, if you haven\'t used a product, please don\'t sell it your loved ones. Keep your ethics above certificates :-) P.S. This is not the case with every internship. If you do an internship with a good company, it could be life changing.
