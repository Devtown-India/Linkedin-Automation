It had shown companies like #facebook #amazon #salesforce #jpmorgan #upwork - all from different industries- have realised that their employees can be just as productive or even more when they work from home. These companies are permanently embracing 'remote- first' model. However, the future of work is now going a hybrid one because in-person mentorship, networking and creativity are more effective than doing it from our couches at home. Now, it's on industry leaders to visualize what should their work paradigm be, how their employees can follow the new work ethics of this hybrid model, and whether they can architect and construct systems that will allow them to meet their objectives? This disruption is still in process.\nPranav commented\nPartially agree. Having a name, which by coincidence turns out to be a slang in another place, is not similar to giving our profiles funny names and bringing it in corporate arena.

Masks of various designs, patterns and even matching to our clothes are available in the market. Recently I saw a video on how nowadays there is a new trend coming up with masks. The masks would have the covered portion of your face printed on it. Using a photo of your face, the same is printed on your mask and given to you. The technology of sublimation printing is used for this. Since face defines the identity of a person, I think this is an awesome solution which is also economically viable to cover your face but still not lose your identity. #facemask #technology #covid19 #innovativeideas\nSheetal shared this\n18 Reactions\nSee all activity\nSee all activity'",b'BMS Institute of Technology and Management\nDegree Name\nBachelor of Engineering - BE\nField Of Study\nComputer Science\nDates attended or expected graduation\n2018 \xe2\x80\x93 2022volunteer\nCompany Name\nAagama Foundation\nDates volunteered\nJun 2019 \xe2\x80\x93 Present\nVolunteer duration\n1 yr 3 mos\nCause\nSocial Services',b'C (Programming Language)\nGoogle Cloud Platform (GCP)\nJava',"b'LinkedIn\n12,568,826 followers\nUnilever\n10,833,577 followers\nBill Gates\nCo-chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\n28,377,530 followers\nDell\n3,107,026 followers\nIndra Nooyi\nFormer Chairman and CEO of PepsiCo\n1,009,357 followers\nThe Sparks Foundation Network\n5,233 members'",b'https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheetal-neeraj/'
