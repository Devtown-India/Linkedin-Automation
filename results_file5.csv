The last month had been a stressful time. I was suffering under insulin dependent gestational diabetes and a risk of preeclampsia. Both diseases are dangerous for the health of the mother and the unborn child and enforce to take important decisions like the induction of premature birth. For me it was almost unbearable to see that many studies in this field only have a few number of patients, are unclear in the way patients were selected and methods chosen. In guidelines it was claimed that more high quality studies are needed. In the end I was often confused which decision would mean the lowest risk of new health problems or mortal danger for me and my baby. Experiencing this confusion I had seen so much potential for #digitalisation, #datascience, #dataanalytics, #machinelearning and #bigdata in #healthcare. Why not using digital health files for each patient or anomaly detection in cardiotocography? What about automatic estimation of babies growth and health issues in ultrasound videos? Why not starting more high-quality studies based on big data? Why not using machine learning?\nLaura shared this\n141 Reactions 25 Comments\nA glimpse of my journey into datascience: #datascience #machinelearning #womenintech #kaggle\nLaura shared this\n64 Reactions\n15/15 - Jackpot :-) - Today the magic happened and I achieved my last gold medal for becoming a #Kaggle grandmaster with my notebook about the classification of invasive ductal carcinoma: https://lnkd.in/dD74UM6 Thank you for this great experience, your support and feedback that often kept me motivated! I started my journey on #Kaggle 5 years ago with a little baby in my arms within my first maternal leave. My intention at that time was to have some fun and to continue and play with some topics I had learnt during the study of physics. Even though I already had knowledge about #machinelearning and optimisation, it felt like starting from zero with #python and #datavisualisation. I had to accept that it is almost impossible for me to take part in competitions with a baby or toddler at home, a job and interrupted nights. ;-) But I enjoyed to grow and learn by writing notebooks for on- and off-competition datasets. It was never my goal to reach my current state fast as there was so much to discover and the tier-climbing-up kept me motivated to always explore new topics. Looking back now I can definitely say that it was worth it.

Avoid the top 10 libraries, the top 10 languages and the top 10 algorithms lists. Start smaller. 10 questions to get you started: 1. Why would one use the t-distribution over the normal? 2. What are the strongest assumptions of OLS? 3. Why do we care about power in experiments? 4. What do frequentists and Bayesians disagree about? 5. When would you use a self join? 6. How can you use a join as a filter condition? 7. What does it mean for R and Python to be vectorized? 8. Why would you use a dictionary vs. a list? Examples? 9. How does the amount of variance affect power? 10. What does it mean to overfit a tree based model? There are so many questions like this that help build the detailed knowledge and domain expertise you need. Answer questions, solve smaller problems.

I thought of cleaning the #data. Requirement was to normalize the single-word reviews of the android applications which have rating 1, such that we can prepare target based on the rating. Findings - a. There are reviews which #language detector failed to identify as non-english comment, when such is the case. b. rating is 1 but review is positive, which makes such reviews garbage if you are preparing target using ratings of the app. Should be thrown out of the dataset, if you are building #sentiment #analyzer model or any application for that matter. c. 47 out of 62 unique words bear either opposite connotation or are incomprehensible in english language. Now, imagine that I use some junk word or opposite connotation word in this post. Yes, It will become incomprehensible for humans to read. How can you expect #machine to #comprehend? Nonethless, Machine can manage with junk using the #context (in case review has considerbale length ) if tagging is correct, using advanced #word #representations and #model #architectures but opposite connotation is definitely a big NO. Note - 65-75 % of #reviews are of length less than 5 words.

The installation guy comes and says, the Ac size is smaller than the required size, may be a sales gimmick. But it's not mentioned anywhere during purchase. So may be the Daikin guys think that the artificial intelligence of a human might signal the size during purchase. Later they don't reply on customer care and talk about a policy which is framed without informing customer. They also claim that similar issues are faced by many others, so a laughter from me, why are you not solving if its faced by others.

It's important to focus more on execution and implementation while consuming such content.

Was fun solving these problems :D Here is my Github Repo: https://lnkd.in/gtd9DWG\n9 Reactions\nThanks man :D\nAtul replied to a comment\nI still remember trying to learn App Development back in my school days, when using Java and XML were the prominent ways of developing native Android apps. Coding even a simple app would require a relatively large number of lines of codes making things complex easily. Fast forward a few years and now we have numerous Open Source projects, like Flutter, that has redefined application development and made developer's life a lot, lot easier. I have always primarily focused on ML, but decided to take a detour and explore App Dev again and was able to get started much faster than last time. This post is only intended to appreciate and remind you about how all the amazing Open Source Communities and their projects have vastly improved the process of software development, not just in App Dev, but in all the fields of Computer Science. Reducing the required learning curve to get started with any project and implementing any idea a man can get to make his or the society's life easier. Oh btw, what better way to give back to these amazing communities than by making software out of their own product (well ofc, contributing directly to their source code is probably even better). So here is a simple app that I made using Flutter ;) Project link: https://lnkd.in/grBX5sW\nAtul shared this\n33 Reactions 3 Comments\nSee all activity\nSee all activity""","b""Data Science Intern\nCompany Name\nThe Sparks Foundation Internship\nDates Employed\nJul 2020 \xe2\x80\x93 Present\nEmployment Duration\n2 mos\nResearch and Development Member\nCompany Name\nWebarch Club\nDates Employed\nApr 2019 \xe2\x80\x93 Present\nEmployment Duration\n1 yr 5 mos\nLocation\nChennai, Tamil Nadu, India\nAI Intern\nCompany Name\nAlphabt Internship\nDates Employed\nDec 2019\nEmployment Duration\n1 mo\nLocation\nChennai Area, India\nMy work as an AI intern mainly focused on Reinforcement Learning applications in Robotics.SRM University\nDegree Name\nBachelor's degree\nField Of Study\nComputer Science\nDates attended or expected graduation\n2018 \xe2\x80\x93 2022""",b'Python (Programming Language)\nSee 4 endorsements for Python (Programming Language)\n4\nSabestin Nadar and 3 connections have given endorsements for this skill\nDeep Learning\nSee 3 endorsements for Deep Learning\n3\nEndorsed by Sabestin Nadar and 1 other mutual connection\nEndorsed by 2 of Atul\xe2\x80\x99s colleagues at The Sparks Foundation\nMachine Learning\nSee 4 endorsements for Machine Learning\n4\nEndorsed by Mohit Kundu and 2 other mutual connections\nEndorsed by 3 of Atul\xe2\x80\x99s colleagues at The Sparks Foundation',b'No results',b'https://www.linkedin.com/in/atul-gopinathan67/'
