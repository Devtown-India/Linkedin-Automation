Today, our world is parachuted by the gathering and dissemination of huge amounts of data. With such a big amount of data circulating in the digital space, there is need to develop machine learning algorithms that can automatically shorten longer texts and deliver accurate summaries that can fluently pass the intended messages. Furthermore, applying text summarization reduces reading time, accelerates the process of researching for information, and increases the amount of information that can fit in an area. To serve the purpose I have proposed an automatic extractive text summarizer model built implementing Google's page ranking algorithm through cosine approach by the means of word vectors and text pre-processing. https://lnkd.in/dpYsNfS Any further suggestions or glitch rectifications are welcome.\nShulin shared this\n9 Reactions\nSee all activity\nSee all activity""","b'Back End Developer\nCompany Name\nTDG Partner Internship\nDates Employed\nJun 2020 \xe2\x80\x93 Present\nEmployment Duration\n3 mos\nLocation\nLucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India\nData Science Intern\nCompany Name\nDight International Chambers Internship\nDates Employed\nJul 2020 \xe2\x80\x93 Present\nEmployment Duration\n2 mos\nLocation\nUttar Pradesh, India\nData Science Intern\nCompany Name\nThe Sparks Foundation Internship\nDates Employed\nJul 2020 \xe2\x80\x93 Present\nEmployment Duration\n2 mos\nContent Writer\nCompany Name\nThe Tarzan Way Internship\nDates Employed\nJun 2020 \xe2\x80\x93 Jul 2020\nEmployment Duration\n2 mos\nLocation\nIndia\nCreating highly detailed and well researched pieces of content regarding some peculiar point of interests in India, thereby guiding travelers to a new, yet reliable journey before they hit the roads.\nSoftware Developer Virtual Experience\nCompany Name\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.

In 1983, fewer than 15% of American\xe2\x80\x99s said they used seatbelts consistently. In 1984, States started passing laws requiring citizens to wear a seatbelt while driving. Later that year, LA Times published a poll stating that even though it was illegal, less than 45% of Americans wore seatbelts. Another poll said 65% of Americans oppose the mandatory seatbelt laws. In 1986 ,The Chicago Tribune wrote \xe2\x80\x9cIn this country, saving freedom is more important than trying to regulate lives through legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d People in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s argued it was safer to be thrown out of their car than wear a seatbelt. They cut their seatbelts out their cars. A person in Massachusetts started a petition to ban seatbelts and got 45,000 signatures. A Florida man told the Florida Sun \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t feel we should be forced to buckle up and have a police officer sent in by the state to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re buckled up."" Think about how stupid you would feel if you were one of those people in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s arguing against seatbelts. If you are arguing against masks, you are that stupid. Just wear a mask.

Feel free to check it out and do let me know what you think about it. Check it out on GitHub as well:-https://lnkd.in/ezmdgsT\n6 Reactions\nI recently completed this 2 part guided project: Analyzing Worldwide Box Office Revenue with Seaborn, Plotly and Python. In this project, I worked with The Movie Database(TMDB) Box Office Prediction data set. I used statistical data visualization libraries like Seaborn and Plotly to generate interactive, publication-quality graphs. The tasks which I performed in this project:- -Visualized the target distribution using the Seaborn's distplot function. -Determined how official homepages impact the revenue of the film. -Checked the distribution of languages across films to determine which language generates the highest revenue. -Created a Word Cloud to represent the common words in film titles and descriptions. -Used Plotly's scatter function to Visualize the Number of Films Per Year. -Determined how the release days impacted the revenue of the film. -Created two different plots to figure out how the runtime affects the revenue of the film. I would like to thank Snehan Kekre for mentoring throughout the project and Coursera for giving this opportunity to get my hands on these python libraries. I have also uploaded the complete project on my GitHub profile: https://lnkd.in/gVfMfRn #datavisualization #python #seaborn #plotly #dataanalysis #programminglife #dataengineering\nManthan shared this\n71 Reactions\nThank you!\nManthan replied to a comment\nSee all activity\nSee all activity""",b'Tech Mentor\nCompany Name\nCamp K12 Part-time\nDates Employed\nMay 2020 \xe2\x80\x93 Present\nEmployment Duration\n4 mos\nData Analyst\nCompany Name\nThe Sparks Foundation Internship\nDates Employed\nJul 2020 \xe2\x80\x93 Aug 2020\nEmployment Duration\n2 mosShah And Anchor Kutchhi Engineering College\nDegree Name\nBachelor of Engineering - BE\nField Of Study\nElectrical and Electronics Engineering\nDates attended or expected graduation\n2016 \xe2\x80\x93 2020\nChatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School\nDegree Name\nICSE\nDates attended or expected graduation\n2001 \xe2\x80\x93 2014Event Organizer\nCompany Name\nIEEE\nDates volunteered\nDec 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 Jan 2019\nVolunteer duration\n2 yrs 2 mos\nCause\nEducation',b'Google Analytics\nBe the first to endorse Manthan for this skill\nPassed: LinkedIn Assessments\nSQL\nSee 4 endorsements for SQL\n4\nKrutik Patel and 3 connections have given endorsements for this skill\nPython (Programming Language)\nSee 4 endorsements for Python (Programming Language)\n4\nKrutik Patel and 3 connections have given endorsements for this skill',b'No results',b'https://www.linkedin.com/in/manthan-shah-826b56150/'

Even if we are using a product for a definite time before writing a review we will have both ( -ve & +ve). Just with sales machine - one can\'t sell products it need to address existing problem.

UPDATE : SOLVED! THANKS! Will post the soln soon. Soln in the comments. I need help with concatenation of two models. Say, using typical transfer learning, you obtain a vgg16 pretrained model without top and add classification layers. Conventional method is, base = vgg16(weights = \'imagenet\', include_top = False, input_shape = [192,192,3]) model = keras.Sequential([ base, keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(), keras.layers.Dense(10) ]) However, if I want to concatenate a sequential model to the base pretrained model, Add(), Merge(), Concatenate() won\'t work. Those usually solve the purpose of parallel addition, i.e., final_model = [model_1, model_2] -> model_3 I want, final_model = model_1 => model_2 => model_3 I tried to search stackoverflow, all I got was the above mentioned.

Are you sure all these companies paying millions in prizes just to let some young data scientists learn some basic skills? I doubt that when Facebook hosts a 1M prize competition on deepfake detection, they expect that it will be taken by some undergrads :)\nDmytro replied to a comment\nThis is quite far from being true. May I ask you, how many competitions have you taken part in?\nDmytro replied to a comment\nThey usually have. Participants are typically given only a limited time to make a prediction. Also, in some competitions, there is a dedicated prize for the fastest solution.

I developed an efficient and accurate deep learning model achieving near state-of-the-art results in the detection of common cardiac problems. The model was created in pure Tensorflow and then deployed as a web-service using such tools as gRPC and RabbitMQ. As a part of this project, I developed a custom Python package for ECG processing.\n\n- An automatic speech recognition system. I developed such components as VAD (Voice Activity Detection) and speaker identification. The system was designed in a way to work well even in the presence of large amounts of background noise.\n\n- A Real-time face detection/recognition system. The task was to provide a simple yet efficient model able to run on a laptop on 15 FPS. I used publicly available implementations of such models as MTCNN and FaceNet and did a lot of refactoring and optimization to make them efficient.\n\n- As a part of these projects, I did a lot of basic research on generative models, model interpretability, semi-supervised learning, etc.\n\nMain tools I used: python, tensorflow, pytorch, scikit-learn, pandas, OpenCV, lime\n\xe2\x80\xa6\nsee moreNational Technical University of Ukraine 'Kyiv Polytechnic Institute'\nDegree Name\nBachelor's degree\nField Of Study\nEngineering Physics/Applied Physics\nDates attended or expected graduation\n2012 \xe2\x80\x93 2016""",b'Python\nSee 24 endorsements for Python\n24\nEndorsed by Anuar Aimoldin and 11 others who are highly skilled at this\nEndorsed by Ruslan Baikulov (mutual connection)\nPassed: LinkedIn Assessments\nDeep learning\nSee 24 endorsements for Deep learning\n24\nJamshaid Sohail and 23 connections have given endorsements for this skill\nGenerative Models\nSee 14 endorsements for Generative Models\n14\nJamshaid Sohail and 13 connections have given endorsements for this skill',b'No results',b'https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmytro-danevskyi/'
