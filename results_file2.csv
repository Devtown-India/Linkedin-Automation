We propose \xe2\x80\x9cCompetitive Policy optimization (CoPO)\xe2\x80\x9d a fundamental policy gradient approach. The traditional methods (GDA) consider linear approximations of the game objectives to design policy updates and diverge in even simple cases. We propose to exploit the game-theoretic nature of the agents\xe2\x80\x99 interaction and explicitly deploy bilinear approximation of game objective. We instantiate CoPO in two ways:(i) competitive policy gradient and (ii) trust-region competitive policy optimization. We provide PG theorems for them, and empirically show that they ROCK!!. They are stable optimizers, converge to sophisticated strategies and score high.

Oh! Ok! But, Why? Because it might happen that for smaller input sizes, an inefficient approach or algorithm might perform better than the efficient counterparts. Like Cocktail sort or Circle sort can match upto the famous Merge and Heap sorting algorithms for smaller inputs. Don't believe me? Need an example to visualize? There you go! Lessons: Always consider large input size (usually N), next time you are going for an interview. Abhishek Somani Source: Reddit.

Thank you so much!\nBevan replied to a comment\nI'll try my best to speak on behalf of everyone who's just been admitted into this program. This is addressed to the mentors of GRIP: While we're all glad to have secured an internship (which is an amazing initiative for students during difficult times), there seems to be a bit of a communication barrier between us, the hired interns, and you, our mentors. Apart from the email that we received, there hasn't been any official validation of our acceptance - whether on Internshala or an offer letter. Moreover, quite a few people here haven't received tasks pertaining to the roles we've applied for (particularly Data Science & Machine Learning). While we're aware that the format of the internship is completely virtual and requires us to work independently, we feel a lack of connection to the work we've been assigned, because of the aforementioned issues. Since it's been clarified that the DS/ML related tasks will be delivered to us in a week's time, we'd like to ask you if there's any sort of official confirmation of our hiring - particularly through an offer letter (or a certificate of completion once the program is completed). We hope there can be a more direct communication channel for us so that fewer posts echoing the same concerns turn up on the group's feed.\n15 Reactions 5 Comments\nSee all activity\nSee all activity""","b'Data Science Intern\nCompany Name\nThe Sparks Foundation Internship\nDates Employed\nJul 2020 \xe2\x80\x93 Present\nEmployment Duration\n2 mos\nLocation\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\nCoding Instructor\nCompany Name\nFirst Code Academy\nDates Employed\nJul 2020 \xe2\x80\x93 Present\nEmployment Duration\n2 mos\nLocation\nHong Kong SAR\nSoftware Engineer Intern\nCompany Name\nmakeLogics Internship\nDates Employed\nFeb 2020 \xe2\x80\x93 Mar 2020\nEmployment Duration\n2 mos\nLocation\nBengaluru, Karnataka, India\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Developed a prototype full-stack web application to validate user credentials and deliver a rating system for chefs around the city\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Strengthened understanding of SDLC and its concepts through projects and presentations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Tested with troubleshooting and logging various software issuesThe University of Hong Kong\nDegree Name\nBachelor of Engineering - BE\nField Of Study\nComputer Science\nDates attended or expected graduation\n2018 \xe2\x80\x93 2022\nActivities and Societies: Wei Lun Hall Football Team\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Recipient of the HKU Foundation Entrance Scholarship\nSt. Joseph\'s Boys High School\nDegree Name\nIndian School Certificate - ISC\nField Of Study\nScience\nDates attended or expected graduation\n2016 \xe2\x80\x93 2018\nActivities and Societies: School Coding Team, School Football Team\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Finished within the top 1% of rank-holders across India in the ISC 2018 examinations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Recipient of the school\'s ""Best Student in ISC Science"" award\n\xe2\x80\xa2 School topper in the ISC 2018 examinations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Nominated as Class Prefect and House Coordinator\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Vice-Captain of the School Football Team\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Event-head and judge of various events at Phenomenon & Transcendence (annual inter-school fests)'",b'No results',b'No results',b'https://www.linkedin.com/in/bevan-varghese/'

Although the tasks were just aimed at understanding and building a few ML models, I went the extra mile by deploying the models on the web. That helped me learn a few things about Web development using HTML/CSS and Javascript.

Abdul Razzaq was reverse swinging the ball violently making it difficult to play. Jeremy Snape was the other Batsman with Sehwag on that day. In between over change, Snape suggested to improvise technique to counter Razzaq\'s swing. Interestingly Sehwag identified that rather than bowler , the half shining ball is the actual problem. He said to Snape "" The next over is of a spinner, let me try for a Six and I will make ball disappear out of stand."" Sultan of Multan, then hits it for six as planned. The above story is very interesting if I look at it from entrepreneurial Journey and narrate it as; Founders Sehwag & Snape were facing a competition from Razzaq\'s innovation. Snape decided to share his thought process over it. S & S decide to find the root cause problem and develop a solution for the same. They found it from their analysis that, NOT the bowler but the half Shine of the ball is the problem. They act accordingly to make the ball disappear. What made S&S win is , the pin pointed pain point identification, team work, and execution. #cricket #entrepreneurship\nRohan shared this\nSee all activity\nSee all activity'","b'Business Analyst Intern\nCompany Name\nSoluLab Inc Internship\nDates Employed\nJul 2020 \xe2\x80\x93 Present\nEmployment Duration\n2 mos\nLocation\nMumbai, Maharashtra, India\nData Analytics Intern\nCompany Name\nThe Sparks Foundation Internship\nDates Employed\nJul 2020 \xe2\x80\x93 Aug 2020\nEmployment Duration\n2 mos\nLocation\nMumbai, Maharashtra, India\nEngineering Trainee\nCompany Name\nGodrej & Boyce Mfg.

Here, I have completed task 1 given by The Sparks Foundation. The task is about Linear Regression to predict the score of a student. I have solved this problem by using two manual methods i.e. OLS (Ordinary Least Square) method and Gradient Descent Method. I have also used Scikit Learn library but I want to explain the basic mathematics behind this regression. So, I request to Aditya Sapate to check my solution and also those procedures that I have used in this specific problem. Here, I have attached the video but the full video is not given. As the video is quite long i.e. 14 minutes, so I have only published the small portion. I request to all of you to check this video using the given link --> https://lnkd.in/ex5nS8a For any queries, you can ask me. If you learn something, that will be my pleasure.

I often read their posts and their efforts to get opportunities for the students amaze me. But one thing that always leaves me worried is the lack of focus on the most basic goal i.e. preparing the students for jobs. This ranges from skill development, CV making, interview practice to helping with placement hurdles like Case Study puzzles or aptitude tests. In 2016, I was placed in a Startup on Day 3. I went to meet the interviewer in person and he simply said the level of preparation is decreasing batch by batch. We are here talking about IITK and on day 3 more than 70% students are still looking for opportunities. In other words,70% students are not prepared enough for potential job. I started looking for a job after a few months of working there, which is common with 40-50% of freshers. I applied for analytics, financial firms, startups and I realised the value of IITK tag during the process - more or less nothing. All the companies asked me technical stuff or case studies, which were directly relevant to the job I was applying for. This isn\'t just my experience, it\'s the bitter truth. Start focussing on learning and improving your skills. Because campus placement is not the end, it\'s just the beginning.\nAbhishek shared this\nDoes the data science interview work? We teach how to crack the data science interview. We don\'t often ask if we are doing the interview in useful ways. Here are 5 things ideas I\'d use more: 1. Even if SQL isn\xe2\x80\x99t part of the position I want to know the conceptual ideas behind it are mastered. Data manipulation is and always will be key. 2. Heavier emphasis on design of experiment and practical statistical analysis. Less flashcard type answers and more in depth discussion of why and how to setup and analyze."" 3. Make a presentation about your work or a major project and its impact a required part of an interview. It says more (to me at least) than reciting how random forest works. 4. Given a half hour to read another colleague\xe2\x80\x99s work, give feedback on it. Articulate what was done well and how you might approach it differently. 5. Give the candidate a chance to have a \xe2\x80\x9cchoice module\xe2\x80\x9d to show what they are best at. Sometimes interviews miss what makes someone extraordinary. What would you change/add/remove from the process? This is a tough question, so any insights are awesome! #datascience #machinelearning #analytics\nAbhishek shared this\n2 Reactions\nIt is vital to know clearly what we control and what we do not. The Serenity Prayer really inspires us. And when we deep dive we understand what we can control, what we cannot, and take charge of our lives #controlling #feelings #actions\nAbhishek shared this\nDear Companies, Please remove JOB VACANCIES posted if you are currently not HIRING. It\xe2\x80\x99s a complete waste of our time preparing and sending out resumes for ""phantom jobs."" Job searching is emotionally draining and this only gives us false hope. Leaving these postings up just to collect resumes is not cool. Put yourself in our shoes. Just be honest and transparent by letting us know you have frozen hiring. Only advertise for live jobs.
